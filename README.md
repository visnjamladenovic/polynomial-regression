# Polynomial Regression - Car Fuel Efficiency

This project applies **Polynomial Regression** (degree 3) to predict a car's fuel efficiency (kilometers per liter) based on its weight.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Project Description
The project trains a polynomial regression model using a dataset of car weights and their corresponding fuel efficiency values.  
It predicts how many kilometers per liter a car can travel depending on its weight and visualizes the data alongside the regression curve.

## Installation
