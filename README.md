# Polynomial Regression - Car Fuel Efficiency

This project uses **Polynomial Regression** (degree 3) to predict the fuel efficiency (kilometers per liter) of a car based on its weight.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Project Description
Given a dataset of car weights and their corresponding fuel efficiency values, a polynomial regression model of degree 3 is trained.  
The model predicts how many kilometers per liter a car can travel based on its weight.  
It also plots the actual data points and the polynomial regression curve.

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn 

2.	Run the Python script:
python car.py

3.	The program will:

	•	Plot a graph showing the relationship between weight and fuel efficiency.
	•	Predict and display how many kilometers per liter a car weighing 1500 kg would achieve.

Output Example
A car weighing 1500kg gets 11.00 km per liter
